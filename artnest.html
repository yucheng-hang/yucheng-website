                    <h1>PERSONAL MOTIVAION</h1>
                    <section>
                        <p>As an entry level UI/UX designer, I found my passion in this field three years ago and started to treat it as my professional field. After that, I was applying for a MFA degree a year ago and now I am trying to find a related job. I personally encountered some frustrating moments during the process. For example, I really want to know someone in the same field as me that can give me some suggestions or advice on career development and learning path. I also expect someone to review and critique my projects and portfolio so that I can be more confident about my work and more competitive in the market. I tried to solve my problems through platforms like Behance, Linkedin and Reddit, however, art and design are a very small branch of them and I cannot find enough resources and information. I am at a loss and sometimes feel lonely during the process of pursuing my dream as a designer.</p>
                        <p>Therefore I was thinking about creating a communication platform especially for student and entry level artists. They are encouraged to interact with each other by posting and answering their confusions and thoughts encountered in career development and gaining peer critique of their artwork.</p>

                    <h1>DESIGN HYPOTHESIS</h1>
                    <p>I believe that creating a communication platform for <strong>student artists/entry level artists</strong> to <strong>post and answer their confusions and thoughts</strong> encountered in career development and <strong>gain peer critique</strong> of their artwork will help them adapt to the atmosphere of debates and critique and finally be confident with their artwork.</p>

                        <h2>Questionnaire</h2>
                        <p>I created a google form and invited 25 people to do this survey. They are all art-related majors, some of them have official working experience while others are currently undergraduate or graduate students.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <br>

                        <p style="text-align: center;color: #767676; font-size: 1em; margin: 0;">Selected questionnaire results</p>
                        <p>From the survey, I found that my personal experience and feeling is actually a common problem for all kinds of artists. Most of the artists believe that it is harder for them to get resources in career development and learning path compared with other more popular majors. Also, most student artists/ entry level artists are not that confident about their portfolios and they have the desire to find more resources or suggestions from others in the same field as them.</p>

                            <p>Usability research showed that users had trouble navigating the app to find learning modules, set goals, and track activities. One of the first steps in the redesign process was to simplify the information architecture to tackle these usability concerns.</p>
